The goal of ggconc is to make it simple to visualize health and socioeconomic inequalities through concentration curves, with seamless ggplot2 integration  that fits naturally into existing data visualization workflows.

## Installation

## Example


```{r example}
library(ggconc)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(food_dat, aes(x = INCOME, y = X_full)) +
   geom_concentration(rank_ascend = TRUE, round_rank = 0) +
   geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = 2) +
   coord_equal() +
   theme_minimal()
```
